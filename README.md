The folder "Tools.tar.gz" contains the following codes (in Fortran90):

1) dump2xyz_4VMD.f90
To generate a file which can be read in VMD and visualize the MD trajectory (starting from LAMMPS files).

2) g1g2g3.f90
To compute the time mean-square displacements g1, g2, g3 for the polymer molecules.

3) pRg.f90
To compute the probability distribution function of the monomer spatial distances from the center of mass of the corresponding polymer chains.
